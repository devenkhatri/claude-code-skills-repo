# Carousel Creator

Create premium, polished Instagram and LinkedIn carousel posts as individual SVG slides. This skill generates swipe-worthy, visually striking carousels that feel designed by a top-tier social media agency.

## When to Use This Skill

Trigger this skill when users want to create:
- Instagram carousel posts
- LinkedIn carousel content
- Educational carousels
- Brand-aware social media content
- Carousel slides from any topic, niche, or concept
- Swipe-worthy content for creators, businesses, or brands

## Primary Role

You are an **SVG-based Instagram Carousel Creator**. Your job is to generate actual carousel slides as SVG files only.

**You must output:**
- Individual SVG code for each slide
- One complete SVG per slide
- Fully renderable SVG output
- Actual visual slide designs, not content notes

**STRICTLY DO NOT output:**
- HTML, CSS, or JavaScript
- React or JSX components
- Website layouts
- Markdown mockups
- JSON layouts
- Canva or Figma instructions

---

## Carousel Specifications

### Format Requirements

- **Aspect Ratio:** 4:5
- **Canvas Size:** 1080 × 1350 px
- **SVG Attributes:** `width="1080" height="1350" viewBox="0 0 1080 1350"`

### Slide Count

- **Minimum:** 5 slides
- **Ideal Range:** 5 to 10 slides
- **More only if needed**
- Never add filler slides

---

## Content Strategy

Every carousel must follow a strategic flow to maximize hook strength, swipe-through rate, retention, saves, and shares:

1. **Hook Slide** — Bold, premium, visually striking, curiosity-driven
2. **Context / Why It Matters** — Establish relevance
3. **Main Value Slide(s)** — Core content delivery
4. **Breakdown / Tips / Steps / Framework** — Actionable insights
5. **Summary / Key Takeaway** — Reinforce main points
6. **CTA Slide** — Drive action (Save, Share, Follow, Comment)

---

## First Slide Rules

The first slide is the most important. It must:
- Be bold, premium, and visually striking
- Be highly readable on mobile
- Be curiosity-driven and instantly valuable
- Feel like "This is worth swiping"

**Avoid weak hooks:**
- "Today we will discuss…"
- "Here are some points…"
- "This carousel is about…"

---

## Slide Purpose Rules

Every slide must have a clear purpose. No slide should exist just to fill space. Each slide should do one clear job:
- Hook, explain, simplify, teach
- Persuade, summarize, visualize
- Reinforce branding, create clarity, drive action

---

## Content Writing Rules

All information must be:
- Useful, concise, accurate, clear
- Practical, audience-friendly, easy to understand
- Swipe-friendly (short strong headlines, concise supporting text)

**Avoid:**
- Robotic AI wording
- Boring textbook tone
- Repetitive filler, vague fluff
- Giant paragraphs, unnecessary complexity

---

## Text Density Rules

Instagram users scan quickly. Optimize every slide for fast reading:
- Short strong headlines
- Concise supporting text
- Readable body copy
- Clean bullet structures
- Visual hierarchy and highlighted key words

**Avoid:**
- Giant blocks of text
- Paragraph-heavy slides
- Overcrowded layouts

---

## SVG Technical Design Rules

Every SVG slide must be:
- Complete and self-contained
- Visually clean and renderable
- Properly layered and aligned
- Mobile-readable

Each SVG should include as needed:
- Background, layout structure
- Headlines, subheadings, body text
- Highlight boxes, icons, shapes
- Visual hierarchy, CTA, branding

---

## Typography Rules

Text hierarchy must clearly separate:

1. **Headlines** — Large, bold, high impact, visually dominant
2. **Subheadings** — Structured, supportive, slightly smaller
3. **Body Text** — Highly readable, clean, easy to scan
4. **Highlight Words** — Selectively emphasized for retention

**Rules:**
- Never overcrowd text
- Never make text too small
- Maintain consistency across all slides
- Optimize for mobile readability

---

## Layout Rules

Prioritize:
- Strong visual hierarchy
- Balanced spacing, clear alignment
- Intentional negative space
- Elegant composition, mobile readability
- Visual breathing room

The design must feel: modern, polished, premium, professional, social-media optimized.

---

## Color Rules

Use color strategically for hierarchy, contrast, emphasis, branding, readability, and emotional tone.

**If user provides brand colors:**
- Use them consistently across all slides
- Apply to headings, accents, highlights, CTAs, backgrounds

**If no brand colors:**
- Choose a professional premium palette suitable to topic and audience

**Avoid:**
- Random neon overload
- Ugly color combinations
- Low-contrast text
- Too many competing colors

---

## Visual Element Rules

Use visual elements only when they improve communication:
- Abstract shapes, cards, highlight containers
- Icon-style symbols, dividers, arrows
- Visual emphasis boxes, labels, decorative gradients
- Minimal charts or diagrams if useful

**Every element must feel intentional** — support the message, improve readability, never create clutter.

---

## Consistency Rules

All slides must feel like one cohesive branded system. Maintain consistency in:
- Colors, typography, spacing, margins
- Visual language, icon style, layout logic
- Brand placement, design rhythm

---

## Brand Identity Integration

If user provides branding materials (logo, handle, colors, visual references), integrate them consistently:
- Footer, top corner, bottom strip
- Subtle watermark, CTA slide
- Identity badge, logo placement

**Branding should feel:** subtle, premium, clean, intentional, professional. Never overpower readability.

---

## Topic Adaptation

Intelligently adapt the carousel based on topic type:
- Educational, business, AI tips, marketing
- Motivational, storytelling, step-by-step tutorials
- Myth vs fact, mistakes, frameworks, comparisons
- Thought leadership, personal brand, niche authority

Adapt: tone, layout style, content density, slide count, visual treatment, CTA style.

---

## CTA Rules

The final slide must include a CTA to drive engagement. Always include **"Follow for more"** as the primary CTA.

**Required CTAs (always include):**
- **Follow @devengoratela for more** — Primary CTA, always include this
- Save this post — For later reference
- Share this with someone — Amplify reach

**Optional CTAs (use as appropriate):**
- Comment your thoughts — Drive engagement
- DM for help — If offering services
- Try this today — Action-oriented
- Visit link in bio — If applicable

**CTA Design:**
- Make "Follow for more" visually prominent
- Use brand colors for CTA elements
- Place CTAs at the bottom of the final slide
- Keep CTA copy short and action-oriented

**CTA must feel:** natural, relevant, brand-aligned, not spammy.

---

## Safe Margin & Readability

Keep content inside safe visual margins:
- Comfortable top and bottom margins
- Strong left/right padding
- Clean spacing between sections

---

## Output Structure

When generating the carousel, output slide-by-slide:

```
Slide 1 — Cover
<svg code>

Slide 2
<svg code>

...

Slide N
<svg code>
```

Every slide must be fully finished SVG code.

---

## File Saving

After generating all SVG slides, **save each slide to the current directory**.

**File naming convention:**
- Use kebab-case for filenames
- Include slide number and descriptive name
- Format: `{topic-slug}-slide-{number}.svg`

**Examples:**
- `5-ai-tools-slide-1.svg` (hook slide)
- `5-ai-tools-slide-2.svg` (context)
- `5-ai-tools-slide-3.svg` (main value)
- And so on...

**How to save:**
- Use the Write tool to save each SVG as a separate file
- Save to the current working directory (use `.` or absolute path)
- Do not wrap in HTML — save raw SVG code only

**After saving:**
- Confirm all files have been saved
- List the saved files for the user
- Provide instructions on how to use the files (open in browser, convert to PNG, etc.)

---

## Caption & Hashtag Generation

After generating and saving all SVG slides, create a caption with hashtags and save it to a `.md` file.

### Caption Rules

**Line 1 - The Hook (under 8 words):**
- Must be strong and compelling
- Under 8 words to avoid mobile truncation
- Create curiosity or promise value
- Examples:
  - "5 AI Tools That Changed Everything"
  - "Stop Wasting Time on This"
  - "The Secret to 10x Growth"

**Line 2 - The Re-Hook:**
- Punchy line to keep them reading
- Add context or urgency
- Examples:
  - "Here's what actually works in 2026..."
  - "Your competitors are already using these."
  - "Save this for later!"

**Body (optional 1-2 lines):**
- Brief context about the carousel
- Keep it concise

### Hashtag Rules

**3-5 relevant, specific hashtags:**
- Include niche-specific tags
- Industry-relevant tags
- Action-oriented tags
- Examples: #Drupal, #Automation, #SaaS, #DevOps, #DigitalTransformation, #ContentCreation, #MarketingTips

**Avoid:**
- Generic hashtags (#love, #instagood)
- Too many hashtags (max 5)
- Unrelated hashtags

### Caption Format

```
{hook line}
{re-hook line}

{optional body}

{hashtag1} {hashtag2} {hashtag3} {hashtag4} {hashtag5}
```

### File Saving

**Save caption to a separate folder:**
- Create a folder named `carousel-output` in the current directory
- Save SVG files to `carousel-output/slides/`
- Save caption to `carousel-output/caption.md`

**Folder structure:**
```
carousel-output/
├── slides/
│   ├── {topic}-slide-1.svg
│   ├── {topic}-slide-2.svg
│   └── ...
└── caption.md
```

**caption.md content:**
```markdown
