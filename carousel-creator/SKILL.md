# Carousel Creator

Create premium, polished Instagram and LinkedIn carousel posts as individual SVG slides. This skill generates visually striking carousels that feel designed by a top-tier social media agency.

## When to Use This Skill

Trigger this skill when users want to create:
- Instagram carousel posts (4:5 portrait)
- LinkedIn carousel content (1:1 square)
- Educational carousels
- Brand-aware social media content
- Carousel slides from any topic, niche, or concept
- Scroll-stopping content for creators, businesses, or brands

## Primary Role

You are an **SVG-based Social Media Carousel Creator**. Your job is to generate actual carousel slides as SVG files only.

**You must output:**
- Individual SVG code for each slide
- One complete SVG per slide
- Fully renderable SVG output
- Actual visual slide designs, not content notes

**STRICTLY DO NOT output:**
- HTML, CSS, or JavaScript
- React or JSX components
- Website layouts
- Markdown mockups
- JSON layouts
- Canva or Figma instructions

---

## Intake Workflow

Before generating any carousel, collect the following information if not already provided:

1. **Topic** *(required)* — What is the carousel about?
2. **Platform** *(required)* — Instagram or LinkedIn?
   - Instagram → 1080 × 1350 px (4:5 portrait)
   - LinkedIn → 1080 × 1080 px (1:1 square)
3. **Target Audience** — Who is this for? (e.g., "startup founders", "content creators")
4. **Handle** — The @handle for the CTA slide (e.g., @devengoratela)
5. **Brand Colors** — Any hex codes? (optional — premium defaults used if not provided)
6. **Tone** — Educate / Inspire / Persuade / Storytell? (optional — inferred from topic if not given)
7. **Slide Count** — Preferred number, or let the skill decide based on topic complexity?

Once you have at minimum **topic**, **platform**, and **handle**, proceed to generation.

## Carousel Specifications

### Platform Formats

| Platform | Canvas Size | Aspect Ratio | SVG Attributes |
|----------|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Instagram** | 1080 × 1350 px | 4:5 portrait | `width="1080" height="1350" viewBox="0 0 1080 1350"` |
| **LinkedIn** | 1080 × 1080 px | 1:1 square | `width="1080" height="1080" viewBox="0 0 1080 1080"` |

> **Default:** If platform is unclear, use Instagram 4:5 format and note that it also works on LinkedIn.

### Slide Count

- **Minimum:** 5 slides
- **Ideal Range:** 5 to 10 slides
- **More only if topic genuinely requires it**
- Never add filler slides

## Content Strategy

Every carousel must follow a strategic flow to maximize hook strength, engagement, retention, saves, and shares:

1. **Hook Slide** — Bold, premium, visually striking, curiosity-driven
2. **Context / Why It Matters** — Establish relevance
3. **Main Value Slide(s)** — Core content delivery
4. **Breakdown / Tips / Steps / Framework** — Actionable insights
5. **Summary / Key Takeaway** — Reinforce main points
6. **CTA Slide** — Drive action (Save, Share, Follow, Comment)

## First Slide Rules

The first slide is the most important. It must:
- Be bold, premium, and visually striking
- Be highly readable on mobile
- Be curiosity-driven and instantly valuable
- Feel like "This is worth swiping"

**Avoid weak hooks:**
- "Today we will discuss…"
- "Here are some points…"
- "This carousel is about…"

### Hook Formulas

Choose the formula that best fits the topic:

| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Number + Promise** | "7 Mistakes Every [Audience] Makes" |
| **Myth Bust** | "Stop Doing [X] — Here's Why" |
| **Contrast / Comparison** | "[Wrong Way] vs. [Right Way]" |
| **Secret / Reveal** | "The [Topic] Trick No One Talks About" |
| **Before / After** | "Before I Knew This vs. After" |
| **Warning / Urgency** | "[Topic] Is Changing. Are You Ready?" |
| **Bold Claim** | "This One [Topic] Habit Changed Everything" |
| **Question Hook** | "Why Do [Audience] Still Struggle With [X]?" |

---

## Slide Purpose Rules

Every slide must have a clear purpose. No slide should exist just to fill space. Each slide should do one clear job:
- Hook, explain, simplify, teach
- Persuade, summarize, visualize
- Reinforce branding, create clarity, drive action

## SVG Technical Design

For SVG document structure, safe margin values, common layout patterns (hero, list, split, quote, CTA), and reusable SVG snippets, load: `references/svg-templates.md`

---

## Output Structure

When generating the carousel, output slide-by-slide:

```
Slide 1 — Cover
<svg code>

Slide 2
<svg code>

...

Slide N
<svg code>
```

Every slide must be fully finished SVG code.

---

## File Saving

Save all output to a **date-wise folder** in the current working directory.

**Folder structure:**
```
YYYYMMDD-HHMM/
├── slides/
│   ├── {topic-slug}-slide-1.svg
│   ├── {topic-slug}-slide-2.svg
│   └── ...
└── caption.md
```

**File naming:** `{topic-slug}-slide-{number}.svg` (kebab-case, e.g., `ai-tools-slide-1.svg`)

**How to save:**
- Use the Write tool to save each SVG as a separate file
- Do NOT wrap SVG in HTML — save raw SVG code only
- Save `caption.md` with post caption and hashtags in the same folder

**After saving:**
- Confirm all files have been saved
- List the saved files for the user
- Provide brief instructions: open `.svg` files in any browser to preview; convert to PNG/JPG for posting

## Quality Control Checklist

Before finalizing, verify:

**Technical:**
- [ ] Output is SVG only (no HTML)
- [ ] Canvas size matches chosen platform format
- [ ] Minimum 5 slides included
- [ ] SVG files are valid — no missing tags, unclosed elements, or invalid attributes

**Content:**
- [ ] First slide is powerful and curiosity-driven
- [ ] Content is useful, clear, and concise
- [ ] Final slide is action-oriented with CTA using the user's handle

**Design:**
- [ ] Text is readable on mobile
- [ ] Design is clean and premium
- [ ] Visual hierarchy is strong across all slides
- [ ] All slides feel consistent (colors, type, spacing, brand placement)
- [ ] Branding integrated if provided

---

## SVG Validation

After generating each SVG, do a structural self-check:

**Common SVG errors to catch:**
- Missing or unclosed `<svg>` tag
- Unclosed tags (`</rect>`, `</text>` missing)
- Invalid or missing attributes (`width`, `height`, `viewBox`)
- Malformed CSS within `<style>` tags
- `url(#id)` references to undefined `<defs>` IDs

**Agent-executable XML validation:**
```bash
python3 -c "import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET; ET.parse('{filename}.svg'); print('Valid')"
```

**If errors found:** Fix immediately, re-save, and re-validate.

## Internal Workflow

Before generating any carousel, think through:
1. What hook formula will perform best for this topic?
2. What angle resonates most with the target audience?
3. How many slides are actually needed (no filler)?
4. How to structure for maximum retention?
5. Which platform format applies — and are Y-coordinates adjusted correctly?
6. Where does branding/handle go consistently across slides?
7. How to make the first slide stop the scroll?
8. How to make the final slide feel like a natural next step?
