## Skill Details

### codebase-to-course

Transform any codebase into a stunning, interactive single-page HTML course that teaches how the code works through scroll-based modules, animated visualizations, and plain-English translations of code.

**Target Audience:** "Vibe coders" — people who build software using AI coding tools without a traditional CS education.

**Output:** A single self-contained HTML file (no dependencies except Google Fonts) that teaches code through:
- Scroll-based modules with progress tracking
- Code ↔ Plain English translations (real code on the left, explanation on the right)
- Animated visualizations (data flow, group chat between components)
- Glossary tooltips on technical terms

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "Turn this into a course"
- "Explain this codebase interactively"
- "Make a course from this project"
- "Teach me how this code works"
- "Interactive tutorial from this code"

### codebase-to-demo

Transform any codebase or automation implementation into a compelling, interactive single-page HTML demo deck for non-technical buyers and decision-makers. The output sells the *value* through animated architecture diagrams, before/after comparisons, sequence walkthroughs, and a business-first narrative.

**Target Audience:** Non-technical buyers, business owners, executives evaluating implementations.

**Output:** A single self-contained HTML file that includes:
- **Hook slide** (Module 0) — two-line full-screen ice-breaker that opens the presentation with a punchy, specific pain statement and outcome tease
- Before/After Toggle (visceral comparison of manual vs automated processes)
- Clickable Architecture Map (SVG diagram with component details)
- Sequence Diagram (step-by-step animated workflow trace)
- "What Would Break If" Explorer (resilience and failure handling)
- Integration Map (hub-and-spoke layout showing connections)
- Tech Stack Justification cards with business reasons
- Deployment & Scaling Notes with **calculated API costs in INR (₹) with USD toggle**
- **Screenshots Gallery** (Module 8.5) — 3-6 real app and code screenshots captured via Playwright, embedded as base64, with lightbox and plain-language captions

**Key Features:**
- Hook ice-breaker generated from real Phase 1 analysis — specific costs, specific outcomes, not vague hype
- Playwright-powered screenshot capture: starts the app locally, captures real UI screens and code, embeds them as base64 in the HTML
- Web search to calculate real API execution costs based on the codebase
- Per-API cost breakdown displayed in Indian Rupee (₹) with Indian number formatting
- Currency toggle to switch between INR and USD views (defaults to INR)
- Live USD→INR conversion rate with 2.5% service levy
- Rate source attribution displayed in the cost section

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "Create a demo for this"
- "Make a pitch deck from this codebase"
- "Show this to a client"
- "Explain this implementation to a non-technical audience"
- "Demo deck"
- "Showcase this automation"
- "Create a client presentation from this project"
